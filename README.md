# Wordle Wars

## A Local head to head version of the craze puzzle game

A little refresh and renewal of my Vue3 (Composition API) knowledge

2 Game modes planned at present

1. Puzzlemaster mode - Once player sets the word and the other player has to guess, more points the less guesses taken, allows for in-jokes/other non-dictionary words
2. "Classic" Head to Head - Each player takes it in turn to save the exact same puzzle chose at random from a predetermined list, more points less guesses taken.

Puzzlemaster mode will be first to be added as this is the newest "take" on the game. (Also I don't need to add a list of words somewhere)
